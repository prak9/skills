# Buy-Side Equity Research Memo

## Core Principle

Start with the investment decision, not company background. Convert a ticker into a buy-side memo that helps a fund manager or investment committee debate whether the stock is mispriced, what could change the view, and what must be tracked next.

Treat outputs as research analysis, not personalized investment advice. For current claims, verify latest filings, prices, market cap, estimates, valuation multiples, earnings calls, investor presentations, and catalysts from reliable current sources. Do not invent unavailable data.

## Defaults And Inputs

Required input: a ticker or clearly identifiable listed company.

Default assumptions unless the user specifies otherwise:

- language: Chinese
- depth: deep version
- horizon: 12-month primary view, with 3-6 month catalyst tracking
- style: buy-side fundamental research memo
- valuation: SOTP when segment structure matters; otherwise relative valuation, DCF, P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/FCF, or industry-specific methods
- scenarios: Bull / Base / Bear with probability weights and implied upside/downside

If the ticker is ambiguous, identify the most likely listed company and state the assumption. Ask only when multiple candidates are genuinely plausible and the wrong choice would change the analysis.

## Source Discipline

Prioritize primary and current sources:

1. SEC filings or local exchange filings
2. company IR website, earnings releases, and investor presentations
3. earnings call transcripts and official guidance
4. exchange announcements and regulatory filings
5. industry associations and credible third-party data
6. reputable financial data providers and mainstream financial media

For every important figure or factual claim, cite the source, document type, document date or filing date, access date, and section/page/path when available. Clearly distinguish:

- reported facts
- management guidance or commentary
- market consensus or third-party estimates
- analyst inference

If a number cannot be verified, mark it as `未核验` and explain what source would be needed to confirm it.

## Optional SEC Data Assist

For U.S.-listed companies, use SEC filings as the factual baseline for reported fundamentals and management disclosure when available. Prioritize latest `10-K`, `10-Q`, `8-K`, and, for foreign private issuers, `20-F` or `6-K`. Use XBRL financial statements when available.

`edgartools` is a useful optional helper because it can retrieve filings, XBRL financial statements, filing text, insider transactions, ownership forms, and recent 8-K disclosures.

If the environment does not already have it, install with `pip install edgartools` or `uv pip install edgartools`. The import package is `edgar`, not `edgartools`. SEC access requires an identity; set `EDGAR_IDENTITY="Name email@example.com"` in the environment or call `from edgar import set_identity; set_identity("name@example.com")` before requests.

Minimal usage pattern:

```python
from edgar import Company

company = Company("AAPL")
filings = company.get_filings(form="10-K")
financials = company.get_financials()
income = financials.income_statement()
balance = financials.balance_sheet()
cashflow = financials.cashflow_statement()
```

Use SEC data to anchor:

- revenue, segment revenue, gross margin, operating margin, EPS, free cash flow, capex, debt, cash, share count, dilution, buybacks, and stock-based compensation
- customer concentration, backlog/order language, pricing, capacity, inventory, MD&A, risk factors, legal/regulatory disclosures, and management's stated demand drivers
- 8-K earnings releases or guidance disclosures when they contain the newest company-reported operating data

Do not use SEC data as a substitute for current market data, forward multiples, consensus revisions, TAM estimates, market share, technical data, or catalyst calendars. Keep SEC-reported facts separate from forecasts and market estimates.

Citation examples:

```text
Source: FY2025 Form 10-K, Item 7, filed 2026-02-21, accessed 2026-06-12.
Source: Q1 FY2026 Form 10-Q, Note 15 Segment Information, filed 2026-05-03, accessed 2026-06-12.
```

If filings cannot be retrieved, say:

```text
未能核验原始 SEC filing，本部分基于可获得资料，需后续人工复核。
```

## Workflow

### 1. Define Company And Research Boundary

Identify the company name, exchange, ticker, fiscal year, reporting currency, primary business, segment structure, latest filings, latest earnings release/call, latest investor presentation, and key disclosure limits.

### 2. Write Executive Investment View First

Open the memo with:

- rating bias: Buy / Hold / Sell / Avoid / Watchlist
- 12-month target-price range: Base / Bull / Bear
- current price and implied upside/downside when current price is available
- core thesis in 3-5 sentences
- key debate and variant perception
- what the market may be missing
- thesis breakpoint that would force downgrade, exit, or re-underwriting

If current price or target inputs are unavailable, state the missing data and provide a qualitative view instead of false precision.

### 3. Map Industry Chain And Profit Pool

Explain where the company sits in the value chain, who suppliers and customers are, who has pricing power, where the profit pool is, what resource is scarce, and whether the company is in a strong or weak value-chain position.

### 4. Analyze Competition And Moat Direction

Compare direct competitors, substitutes, potential entrants, customer/supplier bargaining power, market-share direction, margin differences, brand/channel/scale/network/data/R&D advantages, and whether the moat is widening or narrowing.

### 5. Read Financial Statements Like A Buy-Side Analyst

Cover revenue mix, segment profitability, gross margin, operating margin, R&D, sales and marketing, G&A, operating cash flow, free cash flow, capex, inventory, receivables, deferred revenue, debt, cash, SBC, buybacks, dilution, and management guidance.

Focus on what changes the thesis: acceleration/deceleration, margin quality, working-capital stress, capital intensity, accounting quality, and whether guidance confirms or contradicts the story.

### 6. Identify 3-7 Key Value Drivers

Select the variables that truly drive valuation, such as units, ASP, ARPU, NRR, users, backlog, book-to-bill, utilization, gross margin, take rate, inventory cycle, customer concentration, capex intensity, credit quality, or regulatory cost.

For each driver, state why it matters, past trend, market expectation, management guidance, valuation sensitivity, and the metric that would confirm or falsify the thesis.

### 7. Build Valuation And Scenarios

Use SOTP when business segments deserve different multiples or growth assumptions. For each material segment, include revenue, growth, margin, comparable companies, valuation multiple, value range, and premium/discount rationale.

When SOTP is not suitable, use the most relevant method for the business model: EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/FCF, DCF, NAV, normalized earnings, or milestone/option-style valuation.

Always include Bull / Base / Bear scenarios with assumptions, probability, revenue growth, margin, multiple, target price, implied return, and trigger conditions. Report probability-weighted target value and risk/reward when enough data exists.

### 8. Challenge The Thesis

Actively argue against the conclusion. Identify where the thesis can be wrong, what consensus may be too optimistic about, what risks are not priced, which metrics would break the thesis, and what conditions require downgrade or removal from the watchlist.

Cover fundamental, valuation, competition, cycle, regulation, technology substitution, management execution, accounting quality, liquidity, FX, and macro risks when relevant.

### 9. Track Catalysts And Monitoring Dashboard

List the next 3-6 month catalysts: earnings dates, investor days, product launches, regulatory nodes, industry conferences, major contracts, M&A progress, capacity ramps, price changes, guidance updates, index changes, and capital-return policy changes.

For each catalyst, include time window, event, market expectation, likely impact direction, and tracking metrics. End with a dashboard of the most important filings, operating metrics, management comments, and falsification points.

## Serenity Cross-Checks

Use existing Serenity frameworks as lenses when they fit the company or user request:

- `serenity-alpha`: when the thesis depends on news, product launches, procurement signals, supply-chain changes, or market misclassification. Translate news into observable demand and financial-statement impact.
- `bayesian-intrinsic-growth-valuation`: when the key question is whether intrinsic 3-5 year growth probability is above or below market-implied growth.
- `tam-adj-peg`: when valuation depends on high growth, TAM runway, growth duration, and business quality rather than a simple PEG.
- `gf-dma-health-index`: when the user asks whether the current trend or entry point is healthy, or when price/DMA/ATR and estimate-revision data are available.

Do not force every cross-check into every memo. Add only the modules that improve the investment decision.

## Quality Bar

- Lead with the investment conclusion.
- Support each core judgment with data, source documents, or explicit reasoning.
- Do not replace analysis with news summaries.
- Do not extrapolate historical growth mechanically.
- Show valuation assumptions, not only a target price.
- Include Bull / Base / Bear scenarios and reverse thesis testing.
- Make all unverifiable data and missing inputs explicit.
- Keep the memo decision-useful, professional, and concise enough for buy-side discussion.
